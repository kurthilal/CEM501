### Learning Objectives

- Quantify the frequency and cost of construction disputes using current industry data
- Apply Fisher & Ury's principled negotiation framework to construction disputes
- Calculate your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement) before entering any negotiation
- Distinguish door-opening from door-closing language and recognize common negotiation tactics
- Use de-escalation techniques to redirect a confrontational exchange toward problem-solving
- Write a negotiation memo that documents your position, interests, and proposed strategy

---

## Part I: Conflict Is Normal in CEM -- The Data
**(~20 min lecture)**

Conflict is not a sign of dysfunction -- it is a structural feature of an industry where dozens of parties with different incentives must coordinate under uncertainty, time pressure, and incomplete information. The question is not whether you will negotiate. The question is whether you will negotiate well.

---

### 1.1 How Often Do Disputes Happen?

- The **Arcadis 2025 Global Construction Disputes Report** (15th annual edition) found that the **average value of a construction dispute in North America is $42.8 million**, with the U.S. figure reaching **$60.1 million**. Average duration to resolution: **12.5 months**.
- **HKA's CRUX Insight reports** show sums in dispute averaging **33.4% of contract budgets**, with time extensions sought by contractors averaging **65.8% of planned schedules**.
- An **average of 35% of construction projects** experience at least one major change order. On projects over $50M, change orders can range from 1 to 27 per contract, with costs representing **8-15% of contract value**.

> **Key Insight:** A third of all projects face major changes. The average dispute is worth tens of millions and takes over a year to resolve. This is the baseline reality of construction project delivery.

### 1.2 What Causes Construction Disputes?

The Arcadis report identifies the **leading cause of disputes for the third consecutive year**: **errors and omissions in contract documents** -- which are, fundamentally, communication failures. The other top causes:

| Rank | Cause of Dispute | Root Communication Issue |
|------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Errors and omissions in contract documents | Ambiguous or incomplete specifications |
| 2 | Failure to understand/comply with contractual obligations | Poor contract literacy, inadequate briefing |
| 3 | Owner-directed changes without adequate documentation | Verbal instructions not formalized in writing |
| 4 | Incomplete or unsubstantiated claims | Weak contemporaneous records |
| 5 | Differing site conditions | Inadequate geotechnical communication |

HKA's CRUX data tells a similar story. The most prevalent claim driver across all project delivery methods is **change in scope**, followed by three design-related failings: **incorrect design, late design information, and incomplete design**.

The five most common day-to-day CEM conflicts you will face:

- **Change orders** -- owner wants additional scope; contractor wants fair compensation and schedule relief
- **Delays** -- who is responsible, who pays for acceleration, how does the critical path shift
- **Scope creep** -- "we assumed this was included" vs. "that is clearly an extra"
- **Payment disputes** -- retainage release, back-charges, disputed quantities
- **Quality and rework** -- subcontractor work rejected by the inspector; who covers the cost

### 1.3 The Cost of Adversarial Relationships

Why does construction default to adversarial behavior? Fixed-price contracts incentivize contractors to minimize scope; owners to maximize it. Exculpatory clauses shift risk downward. Retainage withholds payment. The system breeds mistrust.

- A Canadian study found that the **premium associated with the five most commonly used risk-shifting clauses is 8-20%** -- owners pay more when they write adversarial contracts, because contractors price in the risk.
- Research shows that **lack of trust leads to poor communication and adversarial relationships**, creating a vicious cycle: mistrust leads to defensive documentation, more disputes, deeper mistrust.
- Projects that adopt a **no-blame culture** show significantly improved cost certainty and fewer disputes.

> **Key Insight:** Adversarial contracts do not save money. They cost more -- through inflated bids, defensive behavior, and disputes. The cheapest negotiation strategy is building trust before you need it.

### 1.4 Mediation vs. Litigation: The Numbers

When negotiation fails, the next step matters enormously:

| Resolution Method | Typical Cost | Typical Duration | Settlement Rate |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Direct negotiation** | Staff time only | Days to weeks | Varies |
| **Mediation** | $1,000 -- $5,000 (mediator fees) | 1-3 days | 78-85% |
| **Arbitration** | $15,000 -- $100,000+ | 3-12 months | Binding decision |
| **Litigation** | $100,000 -- $1,000,000+ | 1-3+ years | ~5% reach trial |

Mediation resolves construction disputes approximately **85% of the time** without escalation. A study of 449 cases administered by four major ADR providers found that mediation settled **78% of cases**. CEDR (Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution) reports that **60-70% of their cases settle on the day** of mediation, with a further 20% settling in the following weeks.

> **Key Insight:** Most construction disputes that reach litigation could have been resolved through negotiation or mediation at a fraction of the cost. Every dollar spent on negotiation skill development saves hundreds in legal fees.

## Part II: Principled Negotiation -- The Fisher & Ury Framework
**(~25 min lecture)**

In 1981, Roger Fisher and William Ury published *Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In*, based on the Harvard Negotiation Project. The book has sold over **15 million copies** in 35+ languages and remains the foundation of negotiation training worldwide.

Their core insight: most people negotiate by **positional bargaining** ("I want X" / "I want Y"), which is slow, damages relationships, and produces suboptimal outcomes. Their alternative -- **principled negotiation** -- is built on four principles.

---

### Principle 1: Separate the People from the Problem

Construction is personal. You work with the same people for months or years. When a dispute arises, it is easy to conflate the person with the issue.

**The trap:**
- "The electrical sub is incompetent -- they failed inspection again."
- "The owner is impossible -- they keep adding scope without paying for it."

**The principle:** Attack the problem, not the person. Acknowledge emotions but redirect energy toward the substantive issue.

**CEM example -- change order dispute:**

| Door-closing (personal) | Door-opening (problem-focused) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| "You always underestimate your change orders." | "The last three change orders came in 40% above our estimate. Can we look at the pricing methodology together?" |
| "Your team is holding up the project." | "The schedule shows this activity is on the critical path. What do you need to get it back on track?" |

> **Key Insight:** In construction, you will work with the same subcontractors, consultants, and owners across multiple projects and years. A negotiation that damages a relationship is a loss even if you "win" the immediate issue.

---

### Principle 2: Focus on Interests, Not Positions

A **position** is what someone says they want. An **interest** is *why* they want it. Positions are usually incompatible. Interests often are not.

**CEM example -- schedule dispute:**

- **Owner's position:** "No time extension."
- **Owner's interest:** The building must open by September because tenants have signed leases starting October 1.
- **Contractor's position:** "We need 30 additional calendar days."
- **Contractor's interest:** The crew cannot work overtime indefinitely without burning out and making quality errors.

**The unlock:** Once you know the interests, creative solutions emerge. Can the contractor accelerate the lobby and first three floors (the tenant spaces) while deferring the mechanical penthouse? Can the owner provide weekend access that was previously restricted? The positions seemed incompatible. The interests are not.

**How to uncover interests:** Ask "why" and "why not."

- "Why is the September date critical?" (Reveals the lease obligation.)
- "Why can't your crew absorb the delay?" (Reveals the overtime burnout risk.)

---

### Principle 3: Invent Options for Mutual Gain

Before committing to a solution, brainstorm. Most negotiators leap from problem identification to their preferred solution without exploring alternatives. Fisher and Ury call this the "premature closure" problem.

**CEM example -- rework cost dispute:**

The mechanical subcontractor installed ductwork that does not match the revised coordination drawings. The GC says the sub should have checked the latest BIM model. The sub says the GC issued updated drawings two days before installation and never flagged the change.

Instead of arguing about who pays for 100% of the rework, consider options:

1. Split the cost 50/50 and improve the change notification process going forward.
2. The GC pays for demolition; the sub pays for reinstallation (each bears their share of the failure).
3. The sub reworks at cost (no markup) in exchange for the GC expediting approval of pending change orders.
4. Both parties agree to implement a same-day BIM update notification protocol to prevent recurrence.

> **Key Insight:** The best negotiated outcomes are ones where both parties walk away saying, "That was not what I originally wanted, but it actually works better." That only happens when you generate options before choosing.

---

### Principle 4: Insist on Objective Criteria

When you cannot agree, do not resort to willpower or threats. Instead, agree on a standard and let the standard decide.

**Objective criteria commonly used in CEM negotiations:**

| Type of Criteria | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| **Published cost data** | RS Means unit prices, historical bid data |
| **Contract language** | "Section 7.3.1 states that..." |
| **Schedule analysis** | CPM analysis showing actual vs. planned critical path |
| **Industry standards** | AIA, EJCDC, or ConsensusDocs contract provisions |
| **Independent estimates** | Third-party quantity survey or cost estimate |
| **Precedent** | "On the last three change orders, we used a 15% markup" |
| **Market rates** | Current subcontractor rates from recent competitive bids |

**CEM example -- markup dispute:**

The contractor submits a change order with a 25% markup for overhead and profit. The owner says 10% is standard. Instead of haggling:

- Check the **contract**: does it specify a markup percentage for changes?
- Reference **RS Means overhead factors** for the project type.
- Look at **precedent**: what markup was accepted on previous change orders for this project?
- Cite **industry norms**: ConsensusDocs and AIA contracts typically specify 15% for the GC and 10% for subcontractors.

The answer comes from the standard, not from who argues louder.

---

## Part III: BATNA -- Your Most Powerful Tool
**(~15 min lecture)**

### 3.1 What Is BATNA?

BATNA stands for **Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement**. It is the single most important concept in negotiation theory.

Your BATNA answers one question: *What will I do if this negotiation fails?*

- If your BATNA is strong, you can negotiate firmly -- you have a good fallback.
- If your BATNA is weak, you must be more creative -- walking away is expensive.
- If you do not know your BATNA, you are negotiating blind.

Fisher and Ury argue that BATNA, not willpower or bluffing, is the true source of negotiation power. Research supports this: experimental studies show that negotiators who have a BATNA (or even believe they might have one -- a "phantom BATNA") **negotiate more assertively and achieve better outcomes** than those without alternatives.

*Source: [The Power of Phantom Alternatives in Negotiation (ScienceDirect)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749597817300547).*

---

### 3.2 How to Calculate Your BATNA

BATNA is not a feeling. It is a calculation. Before any significant negotiation:

1. **List your alternatives** if negotiation fails (formal claim, mediation, terminate the sub, absorb the cost).
2. **Evaluate each alternative** realistically -- cost, time, risk, relationship damage.
3. **Select your best alternative.** This is your BATNA. It sets your **reservation price** -- the worst deal you would accept before walking away.
4. **Improve your BATNA before you negotiate.** Line up a backup subcontractor, get a second estimate, prepare a claim package. The stronger your BATNA, the better your position.

---

### 3.3 BATNA in Action: Change Order Negotiation

**Scenario:** You are the GC's project manager. The owner added a mezzanine level to a parking structure. You submitted a change order for $380,000 and 18 calendar days. The owner's estimator says $260,000 and 10 days. You are $120,000 and 8 days apart.

**Your BATNA analysis:**

| Alternative | Cost to You | Time Impact | Risk |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------|
| File a formal claim under the contract | $15K in preparation costs; 6-12 months to resolve | Work continues under protest | Damages relationship; uncertain outcome |
| Request mediation | $3K-$5K mediator fees | 30-60 days | Good success rate (~85%), but adds delay |
| Absorb the difference and accelerate | $120K direct loss + overtime costs | Minimal | Preserves relationship but sets bad precedent |
| Escalate to senior leadership on both sides | Staff time | 1-2 weeks | May resolve quickly or entrench positions |

**Your BATNA:** Formal claim (your strongest fallback). But it costs $15K, takes 6-12 months, and damages the relationship.

**Their BATNA:** Hire another contractor to do the mezzanine work (delay risk, mobilization costs, coordination nightmare mid-project). Their BATNA is probably worse than yours.

**Conclusion:** You have reasonable leverage, but burning the relationship is expensive on a multi-year project. Push for a fair outcome using objective criteria (Principle 4), but do not push so hard that you trigger their pride response.

> **Key Insight:** Never enter a negotiation without knowing your BATNA *and* estimating theirs. If their BATNA is worse than yours, you have leverage. If yours is worse, you need creativity.

---

## Part IV: Negotiation Language and Tactics
**(~15 min lecture)**

### 4.1 Door-Opening vs. Door-Closing Language

Research in negotiation discourse analysis shows that **collaborative pronouns** ("we," "our," "us") signal cooperation, while **imperative and blame language** ("you should," "you failed") escalate conflict. Studies of online dispute resolution found that language that "gives face" -- providing explanations, communicating feelings -- **increases the probability of settlement**, while commands and negative emotions **reduce it**.

**Phrases that open doors:**

| Situation | Door-Opening Language |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| Starting a difficult conversation | "Help me understand your concern about the timeline." |
| Responding to a demand | "I can see why that matters to your team. Here is what matters to ours." |
| Breaking a deadlock | "What if we tried a different approach -- what would work for both sides?" |
| Referencing the contract | "Let us look at what the contract says together." |
| Acknowledging a mistake | "We should have flagged that earlier. Here is how we can fix it now." |
| Exploring interests | "What is driving the September deadline? If I understand the why, I might have options." |

**Phrases that close doors:**

| Door-Closing Phrase | Why It Fails |
|--------------------|-------------|
| "That is not my problem." | Signals zero empathy; triggers defensiveness |
| "We have always done it this way." | Appeals to tradition, not reason |
| "Take it or leave it." | Eliminates options; forces BATNA activation |
| "Your crew caused this." | Personal attack; triggers fight response |
| "I will have to involve the lawyers." | Nuclear option; destroys trust instantly |
| "That is not what we agreed to." | May be true, but framing is accusatory -- try: "Let us review what we agreed to." |

### 4.2 Tactical Awareness: Know Them to Resist Them

You do not need to use these tactics. But you must recognize them when they are used against you.

| Tactic | How It Works | Defense |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Anchoring** | The first number sets the psychological range. A $500K opening makes $380K feel "reasonable." | Counter-anchor immediately: "We have it at $260,000 based on the following breakdown..." |
| **Nibbling** | Small asks added after the deal is agreed: "Oh, and we need weekend access." Each is small; together they erode the deal. | "Let us include that in the overall agreement. If we are reopening terms, I have items to add too." |
| **Good cop / bad cop** | One negotiator is harsh, the other sympathetic. The goal: make you grateful to the "good cop" and concede. | Address both as a unit: "I appreciate both perspectives. What is your team's combined position?" |
| **Time pressure** | "We need an answer by end of day." Is the deadline real or manufactured? | "A decision made under pressure is one we may both regret. Can we take until Thursday morning?" |
| **The flinch** | A dramatic reaction ("$380,000?! Outrageous!") designed to make you doubt your number. | Stay calm. Do not revise. "Let me walk you through the breakdown." |

---

## Part V: De-Escalation When Things Get Hot
**(~10 min lecture)**

Construction negotiations happen under stress -- tight schedules, cost pressure, physical jobsite conditions, ego, fatigue. Emotions escalate. Voices rise. Meetings become confrontational. The skilled CEM professional knows how to de-escalate without surrendering.

### 5.1 Five De-Escalation Techniques

**1. Acknowledge the emotion before addressing the content.** People cannot hear logic when they are angry. Acknowledgment is not agreement -- it is recognition. ("I can see this is frustrating for your crew, and I understand why.")

**2. Lower your voice and slow your pace.** Matching someone's anger amplifies it. Speaking slowly and quietly creates a contrast that naturally de-escalates the room. This is not weakness -- it is control.

**3. Reframe from positions to interests.** When someone is shouting about money, they are usually shouting about fairness, respect, or fear. Reframe: "It sounds like your main concern is that your team did what was shown on the drawings you received. Let us figure out where the disconnect happened."

**4. Call a tactical break.** "Let us pause for 10 minutes, get some coffee, and come back with some options." A break interrupts the emotional spiral, gives both sides time to think, and signals that you are taking the issue seriously.

**5. Move to writing.** If verbal negotiation is going in circles, propose exchanging written positions. Writing forces clarity and removes the performative element of heated exchanges. ("How about we each put our position in writing by tomorrow morning and meet to discuss?")

---

### 5.2 The OAC Meeting Scenario

**Scenario:** The owner's representative interrupts the schedule review: "This project is two months behind and nobody seems to care. I have board members asking me why we are paying for a project that cannot stay on schedule."

**What NOT to do:** Argue the characterization ("It is six weeks, not two months"), get defensive ("We have been dealing with YOUR design changes"), or match the energy.

**What TO do:**

1. **Acknowledge:** "I hear you, and the schedule pressure is real. I understand the board is asking hard questions."
2. **Redirect to facts:** "Let me pull up the CPM analysis so we can look at the critical path together."
3. **Offer a path forward:** "Can we schedule a focused recovery meeting Thursday -- just the schedule, right people in the room -- to give your board a concrete plan by Friday?"

> **Key Insight:** De-escalation is not about being passive. It is about being strategic. You redirect the conversation from blame (backward-looking) to solutions (forward-looking). The person who controls the frame of the conversation controls the negotiation.

---

### 5.3 Why This Skill Matters for Your Career

Research on negotiation training shows measurable results. A study in the *Negotiation Journal* found that **over 80% of trained negotiators used their skills at work**, and **30% reported the training impacted their pay or promotion**. Training duration matters: longer-trained negotiators scored **5.2** vs. **2.03** for one-day training. Trained professionals also make better use of BATNA analysis. This is a learnable skill with direct career impact.

## In-Class Activity: Role-Play Negotiations (40 min)

Two scenarios. Each runs 15 minutes of negotiation + 5 minutes of debrief.

### Scenario 1 -- Change Order Negotiation

- **Roles:** Owner's PM vs. General Contractor's PM
- **Setup:** The owner added a mezzanine level to the parking structure. The GC submitted a change order for $380,000 and 18 calendar days. The owner's estimator says $260,000 and 10 days.
- **Goal:** Reach agreement on price and time, or clearly state your BATNA.
- See `scenarios/negotiation_scenarios.md` for full role cards with confidential instructions for each party.

### Scenario 2 -- Subcontractor Dispute

- **Roles:** GC Superintendent vs. Electrical Subcontractor Foreman
- **Setup:** The electrical rough-in failed inspection due to incorrect conduit routing. The GC says the sub must rework at their own cost. The sub says the GC-provided coordination drawings were wrong.
- **Goal:** Agree on who pays for rework and how to prevent recurrence.
- See `scenarios/negotiation_scenarios.md` for full role cards.

### Debrief Questions (after each round)

1. Which of Fisher & Ury's four principles did you use? Which did you forget?
2. What was each side's BATNA? Did it come up explicitly? Did it influence the negotiation even unspoken?
3. Did anyone use a door-opening phrase? What was the effect?
4. Did anyone accidentally use a door-closing phrase? What happened next?
5. Did emotions escalate? If so, did anyone attempt de-escalation? What triggered the escalation?
6. What objective criteria could have helped resolve the dispute faster?

---

## Homework: Negotiation Memo -- Due Before Week 11

Write a 1-2 page **negotiation memo** based on one of the two role-play scenarios (your choice). The memo should include:

1. **Background** -- brief description of the dispute (3-4 sentences)
2. **Your interests** -- what you actually care about (not just your stated position)
3. **Their likely interests** -- what the other party cares about (not just their stated position)
4. **Your BATNA** -- what you will do if negotiation fails, with a realistic cost/time/risk assessment
5. **Their likely BATNA** -- your best estimate of their fallback, and what it means for your leverage
6. **Proposed strategy** -- which of the four principles you will emphasize, which tactics you anticipate from the other side, and how you will respond
7. **Proposed opening statement** -- the first 3-4 sentences you would say at the negotiation table (use door-opening language)

Format: PDF, single-spaced, professional tone. Submit to your repository under `assignments/negotiation_memo.pdf`.
