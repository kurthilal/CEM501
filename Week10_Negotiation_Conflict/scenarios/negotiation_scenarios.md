# Scenario A: Change Order Negotiation -- Unforeseen Soil Conditions

## Context

**Project:** 8-story residential tower, Kadikoy, Istanbul
**Contract Type:** Lump-sum, 24-month duration
**Current Phase:** Month 6 -- foundations and basement construction

During excavation for the mat foundation, the contractor encountered a 3-meter-thick layer of saturated clay that was not indicated in the owner-provided geotechnical report. The contractor had to halt excavation, dewater the area, over-excavate, and import structural fill. Work was delayed by 2 weeks.

The contractor has submitted **Change Order #03** for **400,000 TL**, broken down as follows:

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Dewatering (pumps, labor, 10 days) | 85,000 TL |
| Over-excavation (additional 1,200 m3) | 110,000 TL |
| Structural fill import & compaction | 95,000 TL |
| Revised shoring and bracing | 45,000 TL |
| 2-week time extension (GC indirect costs) | 40,000 TL |
| Contractor markup (15%) | 25,000 TL |
| **Total** | **400,000 TL** |

## Role: Owner's Representative -- CONFIDENTIAL

**Your position:** You acknowledge the differing site conditions but believe the claim is inflated.

- Your independent cost estimate for the legitimate extra work is approximately **260,000 TL**.
- You believe the dewatering costs are overstated (the contractor used oversized pumps) and the shoring revision was partly needed regardless of the soil issue.
- **Your target settlement:** 280,000 TL with a 1-week time extension.
- **Your walkaway:** 320,000 TL with a 2-week time extension. Above this, you escalate to the project director.
- You have leverage: the contractor wants the next progress payment released (due this week, 1.8 million TL), and you can delay it pending CO resolution if necessary -- though you would prefer not to use this tactic.
- You value the relationship with this contractor and want them to stay motivated on the project.

---

## Role: Contractor's Project Manager -- CONFIDENTIAL

**Your position:** The unforeseen conditions clause in the contract clearly applies, and you are entitled to full compensation.

- Your actual cost for the extra work was approximately **310,000 TL**. The 400K claim includes your standard 15% markup plus some rounding up on quantities.
- You know the dewatering line item is slightly aggressive -- you could justify **70,000 TL** instead of 85,000 TL.
- **Your target settlement:** 370,000 TL with a 2-week time extension.
- **Your walkaway:** 300,000 TL with a 2-week time extension. Below this, you lose money on the change and will escalate through formal dispute resolution.
- You are aware the owner controls your progress payment. If the payment is delayed, you will have cash flow problems, but you do not want to reveal this.
- You suspect the owner's geotechnical consultant may have been negligent, which could give you additional leverage, but you have not formally raised this yet.

---

## Negotiation Rules for Scenario A
- 20 minutes of negotiation, followed by 10 minutes of debrief.
- Parties must reach an agreement or formally declare impasse.
- Both parties should document any agreement in writing before the session ends.

# Scenario B: Subcontractor Delay Dispute -- GC vs. Electrical Sub

## Context

**Project:** Hospital expansion wing, Ankara
**Contract Type:** GMP (Guaranteed Maximum Price)
**Current Phase:** Month 14 of 20 -- interior rough-in and finishing

The electrical subcontractor (Volt Elektrik) is 3 weeks behind on the 2nd-floor rough-in. The general contractor (Bayrak Construction) issued a cure notice last week. Volt Elektrik responded claiming the delay is the GC's fault for not providing timely access to work areas and for late approval of shop drawings.

**Key facts (known to both parties):**
- The subcontract requires shop drawing approval within 14 calendar days of submission.
- Volt Elektrik submitted shop drawings on March 3; GC returned them with comments on March 24 (21 days, 7 days late).
- The GC's schedule shows Volt Elektrik was supposed to begin 2nd-floor rough-in on March 10.
- The 2nd-floor framing was not complete until March 18 (8 days late, attributed to a framing crew shortage at the GC level).
- Volt Elektrik did not mobilize to the 2nd floor until March 28, which is 10 days after framing was complete.

---

## Role: GC Project Manager (Bayrak Construction) -- CONFIDENTIAL

**Your position:** Volt Elektrik is behind and needs to accelerate at their own cost.

- You acknowledge the shop drawing review was 7 days late, but you believe this did not actually delay Volt Elektrik's work because the drawings were not needed for initial rough-in activities (conduit runs, box placement).
- You also acknowledge framing was 8 days late, but Volt Elektrik had other floors they could have worked on during that time.
- You believe Volt Elektrik's real problem is that they are understaffed -- they have been pulling workers to other projects. You have informal evidence of this (your superintendent saw Volt Elektrik's foreman at another job site last week).
- **Your goal:** Get Volt Elektrik to commit to a recovery schedule with a completion date no later than 10 days from now, at their own cost. You are willing to concede that you owe them 5 days of excusable delay (no damages), but not compensable delay.
- **Your fallback:** If they refuse to commit to a recovery plan, you will engage a supplemental electrical contractor and back-charge Volt Elektrik under the subcontract's default clause.

---

## Role: Electrical Sub PM (Volt Elektrik) -- CONFIDENTIAL

**Your position:** The delays are primarily the GC's fault, and you should not bear acceleration costs.

- You know you were slow to mobilize after framing was complete (the 10-day gap). Your foreman was finishing a punch list at another project. You do not want to admit this directly.
- The late shop drawing approval genuinely affected you: your supplier would not release materials without approved drawings, which cost you 5 working days of material lead time after approval was received.
- You are currently short 2 electricians because of the other project commitment, but you are bringing them back this Monday.
- **Your goal:** Get the GC to acknowledge shared responsibility and split the acceleration costs (overtime for 2 weeks to recover). You want the GC to pay 60% of overtime costs, estimated at 45,000 TL total.
- **Your fallback:** You will accept 50/50 cost sharing on overtime and commit to a 12-day recovery schedule. You cannot afford to be terminated or back-charged -- this GC gives you 40% of your annual revenue.

---

## Negotiation Rules for Scenario B
- 20 minutes of negotiation, followed by 10 minutes of debrief.
- Parties should reference the timeline facts when making arguments.
- Goal: reach agreement on (1) responsibility allocation, (2) recovery schedule, and (3) cost sharing.

---

## Debrief Questions (Both Scenarios)

1. What was your opening position, and how did it shift during the negotiation?
2. What information did you choose to reveal, withhold, or trade? Why?
3. At what point (if any) did the negotiation shift from positional bargaining to interest-based bargaining?
4. What communication techniques were most effective in moving toward agreement?
5. If you reached impasse, what would be the next formal step under the contract?
