# Submission Guidelines

**CEM501: Communication Skills for CEM — Spring 2026**

---

## General Rules

1. **All submissions via GitHub.** Push to your fork, open a pull request to your own `main` branch tagged with the week number.
2. **Deadline: Sunday 23:59** of each week unless stated otherwise.
3. **Late policy:** 10% per day, maximum 3 days. After that, zero credit (except medical documentation).
4. **Academic integrity:** You may (and should) use AI tools. You must **cite which tools you used** and include a brief note on what you prompted. Copy-pasting another student's prompts or code without attribution is plagiarism.

## Weekly Homework

- Create a folder `hw/weekNN/` in your fork.
- Include all deliverables listed in that week's lecture notes.
- Written work: Markdown (`.md`) preferred. PDF acceptable.
- Code: working Python files with a brief `README.md` explaining how to run them.

## Milestone Submissions (Semester Project)

Milestones build on each other inside your `project/` folder:

| Milestone | Week | Deliverable |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| M0 | 2 | Screenshot or log showing a successful LLM API call |
| M1 | 3 | `project/templates/` with at least 3 prompt templates |
| M2 | 5 | `project/reader.py` — reads and triages email |
| M3 | 6 | `project/digest.py` — generates daily digest |
| M4 | 8 | `project/agent.py` — email agent v1 (read + draft + send) |
| M5 | 9 | `project/ARCHITECTURE.md` — system design document |
| M6 | 11 | `project/channels/` — at least one extra channel |
| M7 | 12 | `project/memory/` — persistence + `project/logs/` |
| M8 | 13 | Full integration, all tests passing |
| M9 | 14 | Final demo + `project/REFLECTION.md` |

## Verbal Communication Assessments

- **Weeks 4, 7, 10, 13** include graded verbal components.
- Rubrics are provided in the respective week folders.
- Peer feedback forms will be distributed in class.

## Midterm

- **Part A (10%):** 5-minute individual presentation on a CEM communication challenge. Rubric same as Week 4.
- **Part B (10%):** Take-home assignment — build a specified feature for your agent. Due 48 hours after distribution.

## Final Demo (Week 14)

- **7 minutes** live demonstration of your communication agent.
- **3 minutes** Q&A from instructor and peers.
- See `Week14_Final_Demos/rubrics/final_demo_rubric.md` for detailed rubric.
- Submit: working code, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `REFLECTION.md` (500–800 words).

## AI Tool Usage Policy

You are **encouraged** to use AI coding tools for all technical work. For each submission:

1. State which tools you used (e.g., "Built with Cursor + Claude Code").
2. Briefly describe your prompting approach (1–2 sentences).
3. Note any significant manual edits you made after AI generation.

This is not about catching cheating — it's about developing your skill as an AI *director*. The better you document your process, the more you learn.

## File Naming

- Homework: `hw/weekNN/description.md`
- Code: descriptive names, lowercase with underscores (`email_reader.py`, not `MyCode.py`)
- No spaces in filenames.
