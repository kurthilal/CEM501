# CEM501: Communication Skills for CEM
## Week 7: Meeting Communication (Strand A — Verbal)
**Spring 2026 | Dr. Eyuphan Koc | Bogazici University**

---

### Learning Objectives

- Quantify the cost of meetings as a communication channel and explain the meeting paradox in CEM
- Distinguish the purpose, format, and attendees of the five major CEM meeting types
- Apply a before/during/after framework to run effective construction meetings
- Use structured techniques (structured comment, clarifying question, flagging) to contribute meaningfully
- Write meeting minutes that function as a reliable contractual record

---

## Part I: Meetings in CEM — The Most Expensive Communication Channel
**(~15 min lecture)**

Meetings are the primary decision-making mechanism on construction projects. They are also, by the numbers, the most expensive and most frequently wasted communication channel in professional life. Let's look at the evidence.

---

### 1.1 How Much Time Goes to Meetings

The data on meeting time is consistent across multiple large-scale studies:

- **Executives spend nearly 23 hours per week in meetings**, up from fewer than 10 hours in the 1960s. CEOs spend 72% of their working time in meetings; upper management spends about 50%.
- The **average knowledge worker spends 11.3 hours per week** in meetings — roughly 28% of the workweek.
- Since February 2020, the number of weekly meetings has **roughly tripled**, driven by hybrid and remote work patterns, according to Microsoft's Work Trend Index analysis of Teams usage data.

---

### 1.2 The Unproductive Majority

The problem is not just volume — it is quality:

- A **Harvard Business Review survey of 182 senior managers** found that **71% consider meetings unproductive and inefficient**.
- Atlassian's 2024 "Workplace Woes: Meetings" report, surveying **5,000 knowledge workers across four continents** (with Wakefield Research), found that meetings are **ineffective at their stated purpose 72% of the time** — whether that purpose is sharing information, encouraging collaboration, or accomplishing tasks.
- The same Atlassian study found workers spend an average of **31 hours per month in unproductive meetings** — nearly four full working days lost every month.
- **80% of respondents** said they would be more productive with fewer meetings.

*Sources: HBR, "Stop the Meeting Madness" (2017); Atlassian, "Workplace Woes: Meetings" (2024), reported in Fortune, March 21, 2024*

---

### 1.3 The Dollar Cost

When you calculate meeting costs using fully loaded labor rates, the numbers are staggering:

- A Bain & Company study found that a **single weekly executive committee meeting** at one Fortune 500 company generated approximately **300,000 hours of preparation time per year** (the equivalent of 150 full-time employees) and cost the company roughly **$15 million annually**.
- Atlassian estimated that unnecessary meetings cost U.S. businesses approximately **$37 billion per year** in salary costs alone.

Now apply this to construction. An OAC meeting with an owner's representative, architect, GC project manager, superintendent, and two subcontractor PMs — six people at fully loaded rates of $80–$150/hour — costs **$480–$900 per hour** in direct labor. A 90-minute meeting that accomplishes nothing just burned $720–$1,350. Multiply by weekly meetings over a two-year project (roughly 100 meetings), and the cost of poorly run OAC meetings alone reaches **$72,000–$135,000** — before counting travel time, preparation, and the downstream cost of missed decisions.

*Sources: Bain & Company / HBR, "This Weekly Meeting Took Up 300,000 Hours a Year" (2014); Atlassian, "Workplace Woes: Meetings" (2024)*

---

### 1.4 The Meeting Paradox

Here is the tension every CEM professional must navigate:

**Meetings are essential.** Construction is a multi-party, multi-disciplinary endeavor. An OAC meeting is often the only forum where the owner, designer, and builder are in the same room making decisions together. You cannot coordinate a $50 million project through email alone.

**But most meetings are poorly run.** The research is unambiguous: roughly three out of four meetings fail to accomplish their purpose. Action items from meetings have a dismal follow-through record — studies suggest that **approximately 44% of meeting action items never get completed**, and **71% of meetings fail to achieve their objectives** because of poor follow-through.

> **Key Insight:** The goal is not to have fewer meetings. The goal is to make every meeting worth the six-figure annual investment your project is making in them. That requires skill — before, during, and after the meeting.

---

## Part II: Types of CEM Meetings
**(~15 min lecture)**

Not all meetings serve the same function. Construction projects use at least five distinct meeting types, each with its own purpose, attendees, frequency, and documentation requirements.

---

### 2.1 OAC Meeting (Owner–Architect–Contractor)

**Purpose:** The formal coordination meeting between the three primary contracting parties. This is where project-level decisions are made and officially recorded.

**Frequency:** Weekly or biweekly during active construction.

**Typical Attendees:**
- Owner's representative (decision-making authority)
- Project architect (and/or engineer of record)
- GC project manager (usually chairs the meeting)
- GC superintendent (field perspective)
- Key subcontractors (invited as needed for specific agenda items)
- Construction manager or owner's PM consultant (if applicable)

**Standard Agenda Items:**
1. Review and approval of previous meeting minutes
2. Schedule status — milestone progress, critical path updates
3. Open RFIs — status, responses needed, aging items
4. Submittals — pending, approved, rejected, resubmit required
5. Change orders — proposed, pending, approved
6. Budget/cost status — contingency drawdown, payment applications
7. Safety — incidents, near-misses, upcoming high-risk activities
8. Quality — inspection results, nonconformances
9. New business / open discussion
10. Action items recap and next meeting date

**Tone:** Formal. Everything said is documented. Decisions have contractual force.

> **Key Insight:** The OAC meeting is the single most consequential recurring communication event on a construction project. What you say — or fail to say — in this meeting can become part of the project record and may surface in claims, disputes, or litigation years later.

*Sources: Procore, "OAC Meetings: Improving Collaboration & Project Efficiency"; AIA/AGC Recommended Practices (2018)*

---

### 2.2 Pre-Bid Meeting

**Purpose:** Conducted during procurement to allow prospective bidders to tour the site, ask questions about the bid documents, and receive clarifications from the owner and design team.

**Frequency:** Once (sometimes twice) during the bidding phase.

**Attendees:** Owner, architect/engineer, prospective bidders.

**Key Features:**
- May be mandatory — non-attendance disqualifies the bidder
- Questions and answers are documented and distributed as addenda to all bidders
- Verbal statements at the meeting do not modify the contract documents unless confirmed in a written addendum

---

### 2.3 Pre-Construction Meeting

**Purpose:** Held after contract award but before work begins. Establishes communication protocols, roles, lines of authority, and expectations for the project.

**Frequency:** Once, at project kickoff.

**Attendees:** Owner, architect, GC, major subcontractors, sometimes the building department or permitting authority.

**Typical Topics:**
- Communication protocols (who contacts whom, response timeframes)
- Submittal schedule and RFI procedures
- Schedule of values and payment application process
- Safety plan and site logistics
- Document management system and meeting schedule

---

### 2.4 Safety Meeting / Toolbox Talk

**Purpose:** Brief, focused safety briefings addressing hazards specific to the current or upcoming work activities.

**Frequency:** Daily (on high-risk projects) or weekly.

**Attendees:** Field workers, trade foremen, safety officer, superintendent.

**Key Features:**
- Typically 10–15 minutes, conducted at the start of the shift
- Covers specific hazards for the day's planned work
- Attendance is documented (sign-in sheet) — OSHA may request these records
- Topics may include fall protection, trenching/shoring, hot work permits, crane operations, confined space

---

### 2.5 Progress / Look-Ahead Meeting

**Purpose:** Internal coordination meeting focused on the short-term schedule — typically the three-week look-ahead. This is where the GC team and subcontractor foremen identify and resolve scheduling conflicts before they become delays.

**Frequency:** Weekly (internal to the contractor team).

**Attendees:** GC project manager, superintendent, project engineer, subcontractor foremen.

**Typical Agenda:**
- Review of work completed in the past week
- Three-week look-ahead — activities, crews, material deliveries
- Scheduling conflicts — trade stacking, access, sequencing
- Material and equipment status — lead times, delivery confirmations
- Manpower — planned vs. actual crew sizes

> **Key Insight:** The progress meeting is where the real coordination happens. If the OAC meeting is the boardroom, the look-ahead meeting is the engine room. Problems identified here can be resolved quietly. Problems missed here show up as delays and disputes at the OAC level.

---

## Part III: Running an Effective Meeting
**(~20 min lecture)**

Research consistently shows that meeting effectiveness depends on what happens **before** the meeting even more than what happens during it. The framework is simple: Before / During / After.

---

### 3.1 Before the Meeting

**Circulate an agenda at least 24 hours in advance.** An agenda is not a formality — it is a signal that this meeting has a purpose. Research from Atlassian confirms that meetings with a clear agenda are perceived as significantly more productive. In CEM practice, the standard OAC agenda (Section 2.1 above) serves as a standing template, updated with current items each week.

**Attach supporting documents.** Updated schedule, RFI log, change order log, submittal register. If participants must review material to contribute, give them the material in advance — not as a surprise during the meeting.

**Define roles.** At minimum:
- **Chair** (runs the agenda, manages time, keeps discussion on track)
- **Note-taker** (captures decisions, action items, attendance)
- Rotate the note-taker role among junior staff — it is excellent training in listening and synthesis

**Set a hard time limit.** 60 minutes for an OAC meeting. 30 minutes for internal progress meetings. The Bain & Company research found that meetings without time constraints tend to expand to fill available time, consuming preparation and follow-up hours that cascade across the organization.

---

### 3.2 During the Meeting

**Start on time, regardless of who is absent.** Waiting for latecomers punishes the people who showed up on time and signals that punctuality does not matter.

**Follow the agenda.** When discussion drifts to unrelated topics, use a **parking lot** — a visible list of items to be addressed separately, either after the meeting or at the next meeting. The chair's primary job is to keep the group moving through the agenda.

**Assign every discussion item an owner and a due date.** This is the single most important discipline in meeting management. Without it, discussions produce conversation but not action. Remember: approximately 44% of action items are never completed. Named responsibility and specific deadlines significantly improve follow-through.

**Summarize each decision out loud before moving on.** This serves two purposes: it confirms that everyone agrees on what was decided, and it gives the note-taker an explicit statement to record.

**Manage multi-party dynamics.** Construction meetings often involve parties with competing interests — the owner wants to minimize cost, the contractor wants to protect margin, the architect wants design integrity. Effective meeting leadership acknowledges these tensions without allowing them to become adversarial. Use phrases like:

- "Let's focus on the facts first before we discuss responsibility."
- "I understand the concern. Can we agree on the timeline and address the cost implications separately?"
- "Let's document this disagreement accurately so both positions are on the record."

> **Key Insight:** The construction industry is widely recognized for its adversarial culture. Research describes it as a dynamic where the "productive system of construction work effectively institutionalises hostility and foments a culture of distrust." The OAC meeting is where you can either reinforce or break that pattern. The chair sets the tone.

*Source: Dainty, Moore & Murray, Communication in Construction (2006); wiki.doing-projects.org, "The Dynamics of Adversarial Relations"*

---

### 3.3 After the Meeting

**Distribute minutes within 24 hours.** Delay erodes accuracy. The longer you wait, the less reliable the record becomes. Research confirms that structured follow-up within 24–48 hours significantly increases action item accountability.

**Highlight action items.** Every action item in the minutes should include:
- What is to be done
- Who is responsible
- By when (specific date)

**Include the acceptance clause.** The standard construction practice: "If no objections are received within [5–7] business days, these minutes will be considered accepted as the official record." This is not just a courtesy — it is a contractual mechanism. (See Part V for full discussion.)

**Track open items across meetings.** Action items do not disappear when the meeting ends. Carry unresolved items forward to the next meeting's agenda. An action item log — a running list with status tracking — prevents items from falling through the cracks.

---

## Part IV: Speaking Up in Meetings
**(~10 min lecture)**

Graduate students and junior engineers often sit silently through meetings dominated by senior people. This is understandable. It is also a mistake. If you see a problem and say nothing, you own part of that problem.

Here are three concrete techniques for contributing with impact.

---

### 4.1 The Structured Comment

Use the format: **Context → Point → Implication**

This structure forces you to connect your observation to a consequence, which makes it actionable.

**Example (OAC context):**
> "Looking at the three-week look-ahead [context], the electrical rough-in on Level 2 conflicts with the drywall start date [point]. If we don't resolve this before next week, drywall will slip by at least a week, which puts the Level 2 finishes on the critical path [implication]."

Compare this to the unstructured version: "I think there might be a problem with Level 2." The first version prompts a decision. The second prompts a shrug.

---

### 4.2 The Clarifying Question

When you do not understand something, asking is a professional obligation — not a weakness. Confusion that goes unvoiced becomes an error that goes uncorrected.

**Example (OAC context):**
> "Can you clarify which spec section governs the curtain wall anchor embedment depth? I want to make sure the submittal we are reviewing references the correct revision, because the structural drawings were updated in Addendum 3."

A good clarifying question is specific, references a document, and explains why you are asking.

---

### 4.3 The Flagging Statement

When you see a risk others may have missed, flag it explicitly. Do not wait for someone else to raise it.

**Example (OAC context):**
> "I want to flag that the concrete pour is scheduled for Friday, but the weather forecast shows rain Friday afternoon. If we proceed without a contingency plan — protective covers, rescheduling, or an accelerated pour — we risk a cold joint or surface defects."

---

### 4.4 What to Avoid

- **Apologetic openers:** "Sorry, this might be a dumb question..." (It signals low confidence and invites dismissal.)
- **Vague contributions:** "I think there might be an issue with something..." (If you cannot name the issue, you are not ready to speak yet.)
- **Speaking without a point:** Long narratives that do not lead to a decision, an action item, or a documented risk. In an OAC meeting, every minute costs money. Earn your airtime.

> **Key Insight:** The most respected people in construction meetings are not the loudest. They are the ones who speak rarely but always with a point, always with facts, and always with a clear implication. Aspire to be that person.

---

## Part V: Meeting Minutes — The Official Record
**(~15 min lecture)**

Meeting minutes in construction are not a transcript. They are not a summary. They are **the official project record** — a legal document that captures what was decided, by whom, and when. Their significance in disputes cannot be overstated.

---

### 5.1 Legal Significance

Meeting minutes hold considerable weight as evidence in construction disputes:

- Courts generally treat contemporaneous business records — including meeting minutes — as **prima facie evidence** of what occurred. The burden of proof shifts to whoever contests their accuracy.
- In construction litigation, meeting minutes are among the **most frequently cited documents** because they establish a timeline of decisions, notifications, and agreements.
- When meeting minutes are inaccurate or incomplete, those inaccuracies generally become the permanent record. Even if an issue is documented elsewhere, an error in the minutes may **undermine the credibility of other documentation**.
- Effective project documentation — including well-written minutes — can **prevent claims from escalating to litigation entirely**, because the paper trail removes ambiguity about what was agreed upon.

*Sources: Shutts & Bowen LLP, "Effective Documentation Techniques for Construction Project Participants"; ACS Lawyers, "Keeping Effective Construction Meeting Minutes"; Long International, "The Importance of Construction Project Documentation"*

---

### 5.2 The Silence-Is-Acceptance Clause

The sentence at the bottom of every set of construction meeting minutes — "If no objections are received within 7 days, these minutes will be considered accepted as the official record" — is one of the most powerful lines in CEM communication.

Here is why it matters:

- Under the general rule in contract law, silence does not constitute acceptance. However, when parties have **established a prior course of dealing** (such as a recurring meeting with consistent documentation practices), and when the contract or meeting protocols **explicitly state** that silence equals acceptance, courts have recognized this mechanism.
- In construction, this clause effectively shifts the burden of action. If you receive minutes you disagree with and say nothing, you may later find that the disputed content is treated as the accepted record.
- The practical implication: **always read the minutes. Always.** If something is wrong — a decision was mischaracterized, an action item was assigned to the wrong party, a timeline was recorded incorrectly — respond in writing before the acceptance deadline.

> **Key Insight:** The most common cause of meeting minutes disputes is not malicious falsification. It is neglect — people receive the minutes, skim them (or ignore them), and discover months later during a claim that the record does not match their memory. By then, it is too late. The minutes are the record.

---

### 5.3 Required Elements

Every set of construction meeting minutes must include:

1. **Header** — Project name, meeting number, date, time, location
2. **Attendance** — Who was present and who was absent (with notation of whether absence was notified)
3. **Approval of previous minutes** — Accepted, or corrections noted
4. **Discussion items** — Organized by agenda topic, capturing substance not verbatim dialogue
5. **Decisions made** — What was agreed upon, stated clearly
6. **Action items** — Who will do what, by when (name + date, every time)
7. **Open items** — Unresolved issues carried forward, with reference to the meeting where they originated
8. **Next meeting** — Date, time, location
9. **Prepared by / Distribution list**
10. **Acceptance clause** — The silence-is-acceptance statement with a specific deadline

---

## In-Class Activity: Mock OAC Meeting (50 min)

### Setup (5 min)

Teams of 5–6 students will simulate **OAC Meeting #15** for the Bogazici Research Center project. Roles are assigned randomly:

- Owner's Representative
- Project Architect
- GC Project Manager (chairs the meeting)
- GC Superintendent
- Electrical Subcontractor
- Structural Engineer (may be absent — at the instructor's discretion)

### Scenario

See `scenarios/oac_meeting_scenario.md` for the full project status, open issues, and each role's priorities and constraints. Review the scenario for 5 minutes before the meeting begins.

### Conduct (30 min)

- The GC PM runs the meeting using the standard OAC agenda from Section 2.1
- Each participant must make at least **two substantive contributions** using the techniques from Part IV (structured comment, clarifying question, or flagging statement)
- At least one conflict is built into the scenario and must be surfaced and discussed
- One student (not playing a role) serves as the **note-taker**, capturing minutes in real time

### Debrief (15 min)

The class observes and critiques:
- Who communicated clearly? Who used the Context → Point → Implication structure?
- Who got sidetracked or spoke without a clear point?
- Did the meeting produce clear, assignable action items?
- Did the chair manage time and multi-party dynamics effectively?
- Would the resulting minutes hold up as a contractual record?

---
