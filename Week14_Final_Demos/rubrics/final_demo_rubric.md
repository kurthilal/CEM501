## Scoring Scale

| Score | Level              |
|-------|--------------------|
| 4     | Excellent          |
| 3     | Good               |
| 2     | Developing         |
| 1     | Needs Improvement  |

## Category 1: System Functionality (25%)

| Level | Descriptor |
|-------|------------|
| **4 - Excellent** | All core features work reliably in live demo; email reading, classification, drafting, and sending all function correctly; edge cases handled gracefully. |
| **3 - Good** | Most core features work; minor glitches that do not impede the overall flow; system recovers from small errors during demo. |
| **2 - Developing** | Some features work but others fail or require workarounds; core pipeline is partially functional; noticeable bugs. |
| **1 - Needs Improvement** | System largely non-functional during demo; critical features fail; unable to demonstrate the end-to-end pipeline. |

**Score: ____ / 4**

---

## Category 2: Architecture & Design (20%)

| Level | Descriptor |
|-------|------------|
| **4 - Excellent** | Clean, modular architecture; clear separation of concerns; well-chosen libraries and APIs; code is organized and maintainable; architecture diagram matches implementation. |
| **3 - Good** | Reasonable architecture; mostly modular with some tight coupling; appropriate technology choices; architecture documentation is adequate. |
| **2 - Developing** | Architecture is unclear or overly monolithic; some poor technology choices; documentation does not fully match implementation. |
| **1 - Needs Improvement** | No discernible architecture; all logic in a single script; poor or no documentation of design decisions. |

**Score: ____ / 4**

---

## Category 3: Live Demo Quality (20%)

| Level | Descriptor |
|-------|------------|
| **4 - Excellent** | Demo is smooth and well-rehearsed; logical progression through features; effective use of real or realistic test data; handles unexpected issues with composure. |
| **3 - Good** | Demo flows reasonably well; covers main features; minor hesitations or setup issues; test data is adequate. |
| **2 - Developing** | Demo is disjointed; skips between features without clear narrative; setup problems consume significant time; relies on screenshots rather than live execution. |
| **1 - Needs Improvement** | Demo fails to launch or crashes repeatedly; no clear plan for what to show; unable to demonstrate the system working. |

**Score: ____ / 4**

---

## Category 4: Communication & Explanation (20%)

| Level | Descriptor |
|-------|------------|
| **4 - Excellent** | Clearly explains what the system does and why; articulates design decisions; uses appropriate technical vocabulary; narrative is compelling and easy to follow. |
| **3 - Good** | Explains most features and decisions adequately; generally clear communication; some technical terms used imprecisely. |
| **2 - Developing** | Explanations are vague or incomplete; struggles to articulate design rationale; communication is hard to follow in places. |
| **1 - Needs Improvement** | Cannot explain how the system works; reads from notes without understanding; unable to describe design choices. |

**Score: ____ / 4**

---

## Category 5: Q&A Handling (15%)

| Level | Descriptor |
|-------|------------|
| **4 - Excellent** | Answers questions confidently and accurately; demonstrates deep understanding of the system; handles challenging questions thoughtfully; acknowledges limitations honestly. |
| **3 - Good** | Answers most questions correctly; shows solid understanding; occasionally needs a moment to formulate responses; generally honest about limitations. |
| **2 - Developing** | Struggles with some questions; answers are vague or partially incorrect; limited understanding beyond the surface level of implementation. |
| **1 - Needs Improvement** | Cannot answer basic questions about the system; appears unfamiliar with own code; defensive or evasive when questioned. |

**Score: ____ / 4**
