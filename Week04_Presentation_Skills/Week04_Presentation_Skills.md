## Part I: Why Presentation Skills Matter for Engineers
**(~15 min)**

Engineers are trained to solve problems. But solving a problem and *convincing someone that you solved the right problem in the right way* are two entirely different skills. In CEM, the second skill is often more consequential than the first.

---

### 1.1 The Fear Is Real -- And Nearly Universal

Public speaking anxiety -- clinically known as glossophobia -- is one of the most common human fears. The data are striking:

- Approximately **75% of people** experience some degree of public speaking anxiety, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
- Of those, about **10% experience severe, debilitating fear** that actively limits their professional functioning.
- In one study, **50% of participants reported high anxiety** during public speaking, 42% moderate anxiety, and only 9% low anxiety.
- A younger demographic is disproportionately affected: only **25% of 16-24 year olds** report feeling confident speaking to an audience, compared to 69% of adults over 45.

The career consequences are measurable. Research indicates that **7% of workers have passed up promotions** specifically because of public speaking fear, and a broader survey found that **45% of people have either rejected a promotion or refrained from applying for a job** due to glossophobia.

> **Key Insight:** If three-quarters of the population fears public speaking, then the engineer who can present confidently is not just "good at soft skills" -- they are a statistical outlier with a competitive advantage. In a room of ten engineers, you may be one of only two or three who can deliver a clear, composed presentation. That is a career differentiator.

### 1.2 The "Brilliant Engineer Who Can't Present" Problem

Every construction firm has one: the project engineer who knows the schedule inside out, who catches errors nobody else sees, who can estimate quantities in their head -- but who freezes in an OAC meeting, overloads slides with data, and ends presentations with "so, yeah, that's pretty much it."

This is not a personality flaw. It is a training gap. Engineering education historically emphasizes analysis over communication. A 2024 study by Coffelt et al. at Iowa State University examined what communication skills construction engineering graduates actually need on the job. Their findings:

- In an analysis of **100 job advertisements** for construction engineering positions, **oral communication skills accounted for over half of all communication skills mentioned** -- more than written skills.
- The most frequently listed skills were **interpersonal communication, teamwork, and leadership** -- all verbal.
- When the researchers interviewed 11 employers, a consistent theme emerged: while new graduates had sufficient *written* communication skills, **they were lacking in interpersonal and oral communication abilities**, including assertiveness, relationship building, and audience adaptation.

ABET -- the accreditation body for engineering programs -- lists "an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences" as a required student outcome. Yet most programs assess this through a single capstone presentation, not through sustained practice.

> **Key Insight:** The construction industry is telling us, through job listings and employer interviews, that oral communication is the number-one communication skill they need -- and the one new graduates most lack. This week is the start of closing that gap.

### 1.3 Presentation Skill as Career Accelerator

The link between presentation ability and career advancement is well documented:

- **70% of Americans** believe that strong presentation skills directly contribute to career promotions and raises.
- In engineering firms specifically, the pattern is consistent: the engineers who advance fastest to management and leadership roles are almost always far above the engineering norm in public speaking ability. As the Engineering Management Institute notes, the better speaker frequently receives the promotion over the better programmer or analyst.
- ASCE has published that public speaking is a "critical skill civil engineers need to learn," noting that engineers must regularly explain and defend their work to non-technical audiences -- owners, boards, public agencies, and juries.

In CEM, the presentation contexts are constant and high-stakes:

| CEM Presentation Context | Audience | Stakes |
|--------------------------|----------|--------|
| OAC progress meeting | Owner, architect, CM | Schedule and budget decisions |
| Change order justification | Owner's rep | Approval of additional cost/time |
| Safety briefing | Field crew, subs | Worker safety and OSHA compliance |
| Bid presentation | Selection committee | Winning or losing a contract |
| Design review | Design team, owner | Scope and constructability decisions |
| Claims narrative | Mediator, attorneys | Millions of dollars in dispute resolution |

> **Key Insight:** You will never present to "a general audience." In CEM, every presentation has a specific audience with specific decision-making power. Your job is not to inform -- it is to get a decision. Structure your talk accordingly.

## Part II: Structuring a Technical Presentation
**(~15 min)**

### 2.1 The Hook-Problem-Solution-Ask Framework

Carmine Gallo analyzed over 500 TED talks and identified three common features of the most effective presentations: emotional connection, novel content, and memorable moments. Nancy Duarte reverse-engineered iconic speeches -- from Steve Jobs to Martin Luther King Jr. -- and found a recurring structure she calls the "Sparkline": a rhythmic alternation between "what is" (the current state) and "what could be" (the future state), creating contrast that sustains engagement.

For CEM professionals, we distill these insights into four beats:

**Hook (10% of your time)**
Open with something concrete and visual: a site photo, a single striking number, a brief story from the field. Never open with "Today I will talk about..." or a table of contents slide.

Gallo's research confirms that **emotional connection in the first 30 seconds** determines whether the audience pays attention for the rest. In a CEM context, "emotional" does not mean sentimental -- it means *consequential*. Show the audience why they should care.

Example hook for a schedule recovery presentation:
> "This photo was taken yesterday at Grid Line 7. The slab-on-grade that should have been poured two weeks ago is still exposed earth. We are 14 days behind on the critical path. Here is how we get back on track."

**Problem (20%)**
State the issue clearly. Use facts, numbers, and contract references. In CEM, this means: which activities are delayed, by how many days, on which path, and what is the contractual implication.

Do not editorialize. Do not blame. Present the problem as a fact pattern that demands a solution.

**Solution (50%)**
Present your proposed path forward. Be specific: activities, durations, resources, costs, and risks. Use visuals -- a marked-up Gantt chart excerpt, a site logistics plan, a comparison table of alternatives.

Duarte's research shows that the most persuasive presentations alternate between the problem (current reality) and the solution (proposed future), creating a contrast that pulls the audience toward your recommendation.

**Ask (20%)**
End with a clear, specific request: approval, funding, a decision, or a next step with a date. Never end with "Any questions?" as your final slide. End with what you need.

Example ask:
> "We need approval to mobilize a second concrete crew by Friday and authorization for the $45,000 acceleration cost. If approved today, we recover the 14 days by March 15. If deferred, we lose another week."

---

### 2.2 Applying the Framework: CEM Scenarios

**Scenario A -- Change Order Justification to an Owner**
- **Hook:** Photo of unforeseen subsurface condition discovered during excavation.
- **Problem:** The geotechnical report did not identify this rock formation. Blasting is required, which was not in the original scope. Contract clause X.X addresses differing site conditions.
- **Solution:** Proposed blasting plan, revised schedule, cost breakdown with three competitive subcontractor bids.
- **Ask:** Approval of Change Order #12 for $127,000 and a 9-day time extension by end of week.

**Scenario B -- Safety Incident Briefing**
- **Hook:** "Yesterday at 2:15 PM, a worker on the third floor dropped a wrench from an unprotected edge. It fell 30 feet and landed 2 meters from a laborer below. No one was injured. But this is a near-miss, and near-misses are warnings."
- **Problem:** Perimeter guardrails on the third floor were removed for material hoisting and not replaced. The hazard was present for approximately 4 hours.
- **Solution:** Immediate corrective actions taken; revised procedure for guardrail removal/replacement; additional toolbox talk scheduled.
- **Ask:** All superintendents to confirm guardrail status on their floors by end of shift today.

## Part III: Slide Design for Engineers -- The Evidence
**(~15 min)**

Most engineers design slides the way they write reports: dense, thorough, and text-heavy. This instinct is understandable -- but it works against how the human brain actually processes information during a presentation. Let us look at what the research says.

---

### 3.1 Mayer's Multimedia Learning Principles

Richard Mayer, a cognitive psychologist at UC Santa Barbara, has spent decades studying how people learn from multimedia materials. His research, published across hundreds of studies and synthesized in *Multimedia Learning* (2001, 2009, 2021), identifies 12 evidence-based principles. The ones most relevant to slide design:

| Principle | What It Means | Implication for Slides |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Coherence** | People learn better when extraneous material is excluded | Remove decorative graphics, irrelevant logos, and unnecessary animations |
| **Signaling** | People learn better when key information is highlighted | Use bold, color, or position to direct attention to what matters |
| **Redundancy** | People learn *worse* when the same text appears on screen AND is spoken aloud | Do not read your slides. Your slides and your speech should complement, not duplicate |
| **Spatial Contiguity** | People learn better when related text and images are placed near each other | Put labels directly on diagrams, not in a separate legend |
| **Segmenting** | People learn better when information is presented in small chunks | One idea per slide. Break complex content across multiple slides |

The redundancy principle is particularly important for engineers, who often put full sentences on slides and then read them verbatim. Mayer's research demonstrates that this *decreases* comprehension because the audience is forced to process the same information through two channels simultaneously, creating cognitive interference rather than reinforcement.

> **Key Insight:** The instinct to "put everything on the slide so people can follow along" is well-intentioned but empirically wrong. Research consistently shows that audiences learn and retain more when slides are visual and the speaker provides the verbal explanation -- not when both say the same thing.

---

### 3.2 Cognitive Load and the Limits of Working Memory

Cognitive load theory, developed by John Sweller, explains why dense slides fail. The core insight: **working memory can hold only about 3-5 items at a time** for active processing, though the classic estimate by Miller (1956) suggested 7 plus or minus 2 "chunks."

When you project a slide with 8 bullet points, a detailed table, and a footnote, your audience's working memory is immediately overwhelmed. They stop listening to you and start reading the slide -- and they cannot do both effectively. Research on student attention during presentations found that **when slides displayed a single bullet point, students engaged comprehensively and read every word**, but **when slides were overloaded with text and complex diagrams, engagement dropped significantly.**

The practical rules that emerge from this research:

**Rule 1 -- One idea per slide.**
If you need two points, make two slides. Slides cost nothing. Cognitive overload costs everything.

**Rule 2 -- Minimize text.**
Research-based guidelines recommend **no more than 4 bullet points per slide**. If you are reading your slides aloud, you have too much text -- and you are triggering the redundancy effect.

**Rule 3 -- Use visuals that carry meaning.**
A marked-up site plan communicates more than a paragraph. A before/after photo pair is more persuasive than a table of numbers. Garr Reynolds, in *Presentation Zen*, argues that slides should be as visual as possible: "The verbal proof, evidence, and appeal comes mostly from your spoken word" -- the slide's job is to *support* visually, not to *duplicate* verbally.

**Rule 4 -- Label everything.**
Every chart needs a title, axis labels, and units. Every photo needs a caption with date and location. This follows Mayer's spatial contiguity principle: put the label where the eye needs it.

**Rule 5 -- Use consistent formatting.**
Pick one font, one accent color, and one layout grid. Inconsistency signals carelessness -- and in CEM, carelessness is a reputational risk.

> **Key Insight:** The best CEM presentations look simple but are backed by rigorous data. The simplicity is the point -- it shows you understand the material well enough to distill it. As Reynolds writes: "Slides are slides. Documents are documents. They aren't the same thing." If your audience needs a detailed leave-behind, create a separate handout.

### 3.3 Attention Is Not Constant -- Design for It

A common claim is that audience attention drops sharply after 10-15 minutes. The research is more nuanced than this. A review in *Advances in Physiology Education* (2016) found that **the greatest variability in audience attention comes from differences between presenters, not from a fixed time limit.** In other words, a compelling speaker can hold attention for 30 minutes; a poor speaker loses the room in 5.

However, several findings are robust:

- Attention lapses were observed at **10-18 minutes** into lectures, with additional lapses at various intervals throughout.
- **Fewer attention breaks occurred during discussions and demonstrations** than during one-way lecture segments, suggesting that active engagement resets attention.
- Including **interactive elements** -- a question, a poll, a brief activity -- leads to better engagement and higher information retention.

For a 3-minute lightning talk, attention span is not your problem. For longer CEM presentations (15-30 minutes at an OAC meeting, for example), build in a reset every 10 minutes: ask a question, show a site video, or shift from data to a story.

## Part IV: Delivery and Managing Nerves
**(~10 min)**

"Just practice more" is the most common advice for managing presentation anxiety. It is also the least helpful -- because anxiety is a physiological response, and addressing it requires physiological and cognitive strategies, not just repetition.

---

### 4.1 Reframe Anxiety as Excitement (Brooks, 2014)

The most counterintuitive finding in presentation anxiety research comes from Alison Wood Brooks at Harvard Business School. In a series of experiments involving karaoke singing, public speaking, and math performance, Brooks found that:

- Participants who told themselves **"I am excited"** before a high-stakes performance **performed significantly better** than those who told themselves "I am calm."
- The mechanism: anxiety and excitement are both **high-arousal states** with similar physiological signatures (elevated heart rate, sweaty palms, heightened alertness). Trying to suppress arousal ("calm down") requires effort and usually fails. *Reframing* the arousal as excitement requires minimal effort and shifts you from a **threat mindset** to an **opportunity mindset**.
- The intervention is remarkably simple: **say "I am excited" out loud** before presenting. That is it.

> **Key Insight:** Your racing heart before a presentation is not a sign of weakness. It is your body preparing for performance. The question is not how to eliminate the arousal -- it is how to interpret it. Excitement and anxiety feel the same; the label you choose changes your performance.

*Source: Brooks, A.W. (2014). "Get Excited: Reappraising Pre-Performance Anxiety as Excitement." [Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 143(3), 1144-1158](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24364682/)*

---

### 4.2 Breathe With Intention -- The Physiology

Before you present, take three slow, deliberate breaths: 4 counts in through the nose, 6 counts out through the mouth. This is not a relaxation platitude -- it is a physiological intervention with strong research support:

- Slow diaphragmatic breathing activates the **parasympathetic nervous system** (the body's "rest and digest" mode), counteracting the sympathetic "fight or flight" response that drives presentation anxiety.
- Research has demonstrated that even a **single session of slow breathing significantly reduces blood pressure and increases heart rate variability (HRV)** -- a marker of stress resilience.
- A 2017 study in *Frontiers in Psychology* (Ma et al.) found that diaphragmatic breathing training reduced cortisol levels and improved sustained attention in healthy adults.
- A systematic review of 58 clinical trials confirmed that regulated breathing practices -- including slow diaphragmatic breathing -- led to **significant decreases in psychometric measures of stress and anxiety**.

Do this before you step up to present. Three breaths, four counts in, six counts out. It takes 30 seconds and measurably lowers your cortisol.

*Sources: Ma, X. et al. (2017). "The Effect of Diaphragmatic Breathing on Attention, Negative Affect and Stress in Healthy Adults." [Frontiers in Psychology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5455070/); [PubMed: The role of deep breathing on stress (2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27995346/)*

---

### 4.3 Preparation Removes Uncertainty

Rehearse out loud at least three times. Time yourself. Know your first sentence by heart so you start strong even if your nervous system is firing.

Specific preparation strategies:

- **Record yourself** on your phone and watch the playback. You will immediately notice filler words, pacing issues, and unconscious gestures.
- **Practice with your slides** -- clicking through them as you speak. A surprising number of presenters practice the speech but not the slide transitions, then fumble during the actual talk.
- **Prepare for questions.** Before the talk, write down the three hardest questions your audience could ask. Draft answers. In CEM, these questions are predictable: "How much will this cost?" "What is the impact on the critical path?" "Who approved this change?"
- **Do not memorize a script.** Know your structure (Hook-Problem-Solution-Ask), know your key numbers, and let the rest be conversational. A memorized script is fragile -- one forgotten sentence can cascade into a full freeze.

---

### 4.4 A Note on "Power Posing"

You may have heard of Amy Cuddy's 2012 TED talk suggesting that adopting "power poses" before a presentation can boost confidence. The scientific picture is mixed: the original claims about hormonal changes (increased testosterone, decreased cortisol) failed to replicate in subsequent studies, and one of the original co-authors publicly abandoned the theory in 2016. However, a later meta-analysis of 128 studies found that expansive postures *do* have a reliable effect on **self-reported feelings of power and confidence**, even if they do not change hormone levels.

The takeaway: standing tall and taking up space before a presentation may help you *feel* more confident, which is itself useful. But it is not a substitute for preparation and structured anxiety management.

*Sources: [BPS: A Decade of Power Posing (2022)](https://www.bps.org.uk/psychologist/decade-power-posing-where-do-we-stand); [Power Posing - Wikipedia (summary of replication debate)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_posing)*

## Part V: Peer Feedback That Actually Helps
**(~10 min)**

### 5.1 Why Peer Feedback Matters

Giving useful feedback is itself a communication skill -- and one that CEM professionals use constantly in design reviews, constructability sessions, and progress meetings.

Research confirms its value in higher education:

- A meta-analysis on formative peer feedback found a **strong causal effect** on academic self-concept and performance (effect size d = 0.72 -- a large effect in educational research).
- Structured peer feedback improves both the *giver's* and the *receiver's* learning, because formulating feedback requires analyzing what worked and why.
- However, research also shows that **peer feedback is a complex skill that requires explicit instruction.** Unstructured feedback ("good job," "I liked it") has minimal learning value. Structured protocols -- with rubrics and training -- produce significantly better outcomes.

> **Key Insight:** The peer feedback protocol we use in this course is not just a classroom exercise. It mirrors how professionals communicate in design reviews and constructability sessions -- identify what works, ask questions, then suggest improvements. Master this protocol and you will be better at every review meeting in your career.

*Sources: [Springer: Peer Feedback Improves Students' Academic Self-Concept in Higher Education](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11162-020-09591-y); [Taylor & Francis: Impact of Formative Peer Feedback -- Meta-Analysis](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02602938.2018.1545896)*

---

### 5.2 The Strength-Question-Suggestion Protocol

We will use this protocol all semester. Memorize it.

| Step | What to Do | Example | Time |
|------|------------|---------|------|
| **1. Strength** | Name one specific thing that worked well | "Your site photo as the opening hook immediately set the context -- I understood the problem before you said a word." | 30 sec |
| **2. Question** | Ask a clarifying question about content or delivery | "You mentioned a 14-day delay -- is that on the critical path or a secondary path?" | 30 sec |
| **3. Suggestion** | Offer one concrete, actionable improvement | "Your cost slide had six rows of data. You could try highlighting only the total and the largest line item, and put the full breakdown in a handout." | 30 sec |

Rules:
- **Be specific.** "Good job" is not feedback. "Your transition from the problem slide to the solution was seamless because you used the same site plan in both" is feedback.
- **Focus on the presentation, not the person.** Say "the slide was dense" not "you overloaded us."
- **Frame suggestions constructively:** "You could try..." rather than "You should not..."
- **One suggestion only.** Resist the urge to list five improvements. One actionable item is more useful than five vague ones.

---

## In-Class Activity: 3-Minute Lightning Talks
**(60 min, full session)**

### Preparation (before class)

Prepare a 3-minute presentation on one of the following CEM topics:

- A **schedule delay** you would report at an OAC meeting (explain the cause, impact, and proposed recovery)
- A **change order justification** to the owner (present the differing condition, cost, and contract basis)
- A **safety incident briefing** for the project team (describe the incident, root cause, and corrective actions)
- A **constructability concern** during the design review phase (identify the issue, propose alternatives, recommend a path forward)

Requirements:
- **Maximum 4 slides.** Use the Hook-Problem-Solution-Ask structure.
- **No bullet-point walls.** Apply the slide design principles from Part III.
- **End with a clear Ask.** What decision do you need from the audience?

### In Class

1. **Talks (35 min)** -- Each student presents for 3 minutes. A timer will be visible on screen. At 3:00, you stop. This is non-negotiable -- in a real OAC meeting, your window is equally strict.

2. **Peer feedback (20 min)** -- After each talk, one assigned peer gives verbal feedback using the Strength-Question-Suggestion protocol. All other students fill out written feedback cards (also using the protocol).

3. **Debrief (5 min)** -- Common patterns observed, top tips, and encouragement. We will discuss: What hooks worked best? Where did presenters lose the audience? Which asks were clearest?

### Assessment

Presentations will be evaluated using the rubric at `rubrics/presentation_rubric.md`. Review it before preparing your talk. Key criteria:

- **Structure** -- Did you follow Hook-Problem-Solution-Ask?
- **Clarity and conciseness** -- Could the audience follow your argument in 3 minutes?
- **Slide design** -- One idea per slide, minimal text, meaningful visuals, proper labeling?
- **Delivery** -- Eye contact, pace, vocal variety, confidence?
- **The Ask** -- Did you end with a clear, specific request?

---

## Homework

### Self-Assessment Reflection

After your lightning talk and receiving peer feedback, write a 1-page reflection (approximately 300-400 words) addressing:

1. What was the strongest aspect of your presentation and why? Connect your answer to a specific principle from today's lecture (e.g., Hook effectiveness, Mayer's coherence principle, the reframing technique).
2. What was the most useful piece of feedback you received? Why was it useful -- what will you change as a result?
3. What specific, measurable action will you take to improve for your next presentation? (Not "practice more" -- something concrete, like "I will reduce my slides to one idea each and rehearse with a timer three times.")
4. On a scale of 1-10, how nervous were you before presenting? Did you try any of the strategies from Part IV (reframing, breathing, preparation)? What happened?

Save as `project/reflections/week04_presentation_reflection.md`. Commit and push.

**Due:** Before Week 5 session.

Grading: Completion and depth of self-analysis. There is no "right answer" -- honest, specific reflection is what matters.
